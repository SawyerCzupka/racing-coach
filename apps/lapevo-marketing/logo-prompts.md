## Background Context (included in all prompts)

> LapEvo is an AI-powered telemetry analysis tool for sim racing (iRacing). It captures real-time data, compares lap times, analyzes cornering and braking points, and provides coaching insights to help drivers improve. The name combines "Lap" (racing laps) and "Evo" (evolution/improvement).

## Prompt 1: Core Brand

```
Design a logo for "LapEvo" - an AI-powered telemetry analysis tool for sim racing. It captures real-time driving data, analyzes lap times, and helps racers improve through data-driven coaching.

Style preferences:
- Modern, sleek, and technical aesthetic
- Abstract geometric shapes (not literal racing imagery like cars or flags)
- Clean and minimal - should work as a small favicon
- Inspired by tech product logos like Linear, Jira, Stripe, or Vercel
- Dark background with blue accent colors preferred

Create a distinctive logomark that conveys precision, progress, and forward momentum.
```

## Prompt 2: Emphasis on Data/Analytics

```
Create a logo for "LapEvo" - a data analytics platform for sim racers. The product analyzes telemetry data (speed, braking, racing lines) to help drivers find faster lap times.

Style direction:
- Abstract and geometric, avoiding literal racing symbols
- Should feel like a modern SaaS/developer tool brand
- Technical and precise, appealing to data-focused users
- Minimal enough to work at 32x32 pixels
- Think Linear, Notion, or Figma's design language

The logo should subtly suggest analysis, improvement, or optimization without being obvious about it.
```

## Prompt 3: Emphasis on Evolution/Progress

```
Design a logomark for "LapEvo" - the name combines "Lap" (racing) and "Evolution" (continuous improvement). It's an AI coaching tool that helps sim racers get faster over time by analyzing their driving data.

Design requirements:
- Pure geometric abstraction - no letters, cars, or racing clichés
- Convey a sense of progression, iteration, or forward motion
- Modern tech aesthetic similar to Stripe, Vercel, or Linear
- Must be distinctive and memorable at small sizes
- Color palette: blues on dark background

Create something that feels premium and technical.
```

## Prompt 4: Minimal Tech Aesthetic

```
Create a minimal, abstract logo for a developer-focused product called "LapEvo". It's a technical tool that uses AI to analyze racing telemetry data and provide performance insights.

Guidelines:
- Geometric shapes only - no text, no literal imagery
- Inspired by the clean aesthetic of Linear, Raycast, and Arc browser logos
- Should feel at home in a dark-mode UI
- Conveys precision and sophistication
- Works perfectly as a favicon or app icon

Think of how companies like Stripe or Vercel approach their brand marks - confident, minimal, timeless.
```

## Prompt 5: Motion and Speed (Abstract)

```
Design an abstract logomark for "LapEvo", an AI-powered racing analysis tool. The product helps sim racers improve by analyzing their driving data lap after lap.

Creative direction:
- Abstract geometry that suggests motion or velocity without being literal
- Modern SaaS aesthetic - think Linear, Jira, or Figma
- No racing clichés (no checkered flags, no cars, no steering wheels)
- Clean enough to work as a 32px favicon
- Blue tones on dark background preferred

The mark should feel dynamic yet precise - like data in motion.
```

## Prompt 6: Open Creative Brief

```
Create a logo for "LapEvo" - an AI telemetry coach for sim racing that analyzes driving data to help racers improve their lap times.

I'm looking for something:
- Abstract and geometric
- Modern and minimal (like Linear, Notion, Vercel logos)
- Technical but not cold
- Distinctive and memorable
- Works at small sizes (favicon)

Avoid: literal racing imagery, letters/text, anything generic or clip-art-like.

Surprise me with a creative interpretation that captures the essence of continuous improvement through data.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Generate multiple times** - Run each prompt 3-4 times to see variety
2. **Iterate** - If you like a direction, ask Gemini to refine it
3. **Combine** - "Take the shape from image 1 but with the style of image 3"
4. **Specify format** - Add "vector style" or "flat design" if results are too rendered/3D
5. **Adjust colors** - If colors are off, regenerate with specific hex codes (#3b82f6, #0f172a)
