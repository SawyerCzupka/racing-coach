## Welcome to LapEvo (HI)

We're building the future of sim racing telemetry analysis. LapEvo combines professional-grade telemetry tools with modern AI to help you find those crucial tenths of a second.

## What We're Building

LapEvo is designed from the ground up for iRacing, with features that matter most to competitive sim racers:

- **Real-time telemetry capture** - Automatic data collection as you drive
- **Corner-by-corner analysis** - Understand exactly where you're gaining or losing time
- **AI coaching insights** - Get personalized suggestions based on your driving patterns
- **Lap comparison** - Overlay any two laps to see the differences
